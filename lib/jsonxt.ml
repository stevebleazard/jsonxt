    various access methods and levels of compliance with the JSON standard.
    Access methods include
    - File and string parsing including [Stream.t] support
    - A stream parser that delivers a stream of json tokens rather than a
      whole json tree with  [Stream.t] support.
    - a monadic parser

    JSON compliance has a number of levels
    - Extended supports floats and integers as well as tuples and variants from Yojson
    - Basic supports floats and integers
    - Strict only supports floats with integers converted to floats
    
    In addition a Yojson compatability modules supports basic Yojson functions
    including inter-operability with [ppx_deriving_yojson] and [ppx_yojson_conv]

    {1 Writers}
    [Jsonxt] supports writers for each of the access methods and compliance levels
    including compact and human readable versions. This includes
    - File, string and channel output
    - Stream writer for a json token stream such as produded bu the stream parser
    - A monadic writer
